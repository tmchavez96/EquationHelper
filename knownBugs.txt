*add step with longer term(+2x)
	-cant simply reverse string(would be x 2 + instead of 2x+)

*compact doesnt work on constants with exponents
 	-elms with size less than 100 in the row are in the comparison string
	-filter out strings lesser size elms to their own string?
	-or use elm.sup to decide intstead of size?
